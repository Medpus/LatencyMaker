# For latency VR project

# Reminder to set latency to 0 after you're done so you don't screw ove the next person
# using the gaming PC!
# I wrote this myself, was unhappy, asked ChatGPT for advice, then I realized
# it doesn't actually understand anything, so I wrote the final version myself.
# Since there may or may not be a current qdisc rule, and input (if provided) may or may not
# be 0, we get the resulting tree of 'if' checks. It ain't pretty, but it's honest work.
# Also, remember to call source ~/.bashrc to be able to use its (updated) contents!
# Since this is a bash script, its calls can be used from anywhere after you've done that!

# Function: setlat
# Correct usage: setlat <x>
# This function sets the current latency rule, affecting the Ethernet latency on the gaming-PC
# from our current interface that we specify below
# (See Settings > Network for this, as entries correspond to the Ethernet cables plugged in).
# It also prints the result to terminal with time stamp for later documentation.
# Here's what it does:
# NB! Here, we assume input is an integer
# 1. Checks whether input <x> is provided. If not, it complains.
# 2. Otherwise, <x> was provided. If it is 0, we remove the current rule if possible.
# 3. Input wasn't 0, so we either change the existing rule or make a new if there isn't one.
